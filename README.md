Algs4 Java Environment
----------------------

Algs4 Java set up for https://class.coursera.org/algs4partI-006.

This repository uses `grunt` to automatically run

```
checkstyle-algs4
javac-algs4
```

whenever a `.java` file is saved.

and

```
findbugs-algs4
```

whenever a `.class` file is saved.

These tasks are completed automatically on save, as a time-saving device.


Note: Do NOT attempt to post solutions here, nor expect to find any.

Setup
-----

Install NPM if you don't have it already.

`npm install`
`npm install -g grunt-cli`
`grunt`
